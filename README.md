Photoshop Script to Create iPhone Icons from iTunesArtwork

WARNING!!! In the rare case that there are name collisions, this script will
overwrite (delete permanently) files in the same folder in which the selected
iTunesArtwork file is located. Therefore, to be safe, before running the
script, it's best to make sure the selected iTuensArtwork file is the only
file in its containing folder.
